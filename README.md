All-in-One WP Migration-Backup-Finder

Based off the work from https://vavkamil.cz/2020/03/25/all-in-one-wp-migration/

This will smash the fuck outta the server to give up a backup it's not a 100% affective way but does a job.

It will send around 52k requests so be prepared to get abused by the system admin for generating loads of 404 logs or it causing the log system to be hammered.


Needs Wfuzz installed!
